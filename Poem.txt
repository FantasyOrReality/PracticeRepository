What is reality?

A blank canvas for the creative?
A plain of imagination for a collective?
A played game for the competitive?

No, it's fantasy!



[Both realities are in contact, they have managed to edit the poem and show their sides of insanity.]
[Testing phase successful, the plan may continue]
